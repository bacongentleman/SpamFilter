# SpamFilter
Basic spam filtering practice in c++

Takes in a subject line and a body message as input (strings) and checks them for basic spam triggers used in emails. Each spam trigger is valued at a certain number of points. If the points go above 100 then the email is classified as spam. You can test out the email as many times as you like.
